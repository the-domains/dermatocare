But, how can a feeling for which whole human kind is hankering for vary with time, place, person or circumstances? Is happiness abstract? Is abstract achievable?</p><p>If happiness is the end result of positive thoughts that sparkles from feeling of contentment, then what is stopping us from being satisfied? If we all understand the true meaning of “grass is greener on other side”, then why are we unable to come out of this race of chasing greener grass every day? If we all know there is nothing like “perfect” in this world; none of our relations, work, holiday, possessions, and me "myself" can be “perfect”; then why are we not coming out of this vicious trap of expecting “perfection”? If we all agree with the fact that money cannot buy happiness but yes it can buy comfort; then why are we not setting limits for our comfort and be happy?</p><p>Research also suggests that happiness is a combination of how satisfied we are with our life and how good we feel on a day-to-day basis rather than momentary time of elation as a result of alcohol, drugs, possessions or relationships.</p><p>So, what is happiness? We all agree that happiness is being satisfied with what we have. But this does not mean that we sit back satisfied with illness, poverty or problems; happiness lies in fighting the tough times with best of efforts without lamentations or expectation of results. Interestingly, some might face tough times in trivial things like choosing the right dress for a party while others might face the same degree of anxiety in an interview for a job he/she always wanted. </p><p>So, the key to happiness is satisfaction and satisfaction comes from accepting our present situation without lamentation. We all have experienced that lamentations cannot improve our present situations, rather complicate them further by draining out our positive energy. Like every dark cloud has a silver lining; happiness lies in finding the ray of hope in our tough times. Happiness is understanding that "failures are stepping stone to success"; and gathering courage to climb that stone of hurdle to reach success.</p><p>Lamentation foster agitation and one cannot put in sincere efforts with agitated mind. Once our mind is out of turmoil that tough times brings, happiness lies in doing our duties with sincere efforts without expectation for results. Expectation of results, is like giving the key of our happiness in to the hands of our boss, relations or consumers. The good result of our effort should be considered as blessing from God while the bad results to be result of your past deeds. Taking credit of work inflates the false ego within us; this state of temporary happiness associated with false ego is sure to dwindle.</p><p>Happiness is thus not abstract, but right there infront of you waiting for you to knock its door. All it takes is a little change of seeing the good around you and enjoying the journey to achieve your goals in life; putting in your sincere efforts and leaving the fruits of your action to the Almighty.</p><picture>
